harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



nonmagic people more commonly known as



muggles were particularly afraid of magic in medieval



times but not very good at recognizing it on the rare



occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard



burning had no effect whatsoever the witch or wizard



would perform a basic flame freezing charm and



then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a



gentle tickling sensation indeed wendelin the weird



enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed



herself to be caught no less than fortyseven times in



various disguises



harry put his quill between his teeth and reached



underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of



parchment slowly and very carefully he unscrewed



the ink bottle dipped his quill into it and began to



write pausing every now and then to listen because



if any of the dursleys heard the scratching of his quill



on their way to the bathroom hed probably find



himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for



the rest of the summer



the dursley family of number four privet drive was



the reason that harry never enjoyed his summer



holidays uncle vernon aunt petunia and their son



dudley were harrys only living relatives they were



muggles and they had a very medieval attitude



toward magic harrys dead parents who had been a



witch and wizard themselves were never mentioned



under the dursleys roof for years aunt petunia and



uncle vernon had hoped that if they kept harry as



downtrodden as possible they would be able to



squash the magic out of him to their fury they had



been unsuccessful these days they lived in terror of



anyone finding out that harry had spent most of the



last two years at hogwarts school of witchcraft and



wizardry the most they could do however was to



lock away harrys spellbooks wand cauldron and



p a g e  



harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



broomstick at the start of the summer break and



forbid him to talk to the neighbors



this separation from his spellbooks had been a real



problem for harry because his teachers at hogwarts



had given him a lot of holiday work one of the



essays a particularly nasty one about shrinking



potions was for harrys least favorite teacher



professor snape who would be delighted to have an



excuse to give harry detention for a month harry had



therefore seized his chance in the first week of the



holidays while uncle vernon aunt petunia and



dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire



uncle vernons new company car in very loud voices



so that the rest of the street would notice it too



harry had crept downstairs picked the lock on the



cupboard under the stairs grabbed some of his



books and hidden them in his bedroom as long as



he didnt leave spots of ink on the sheets the



dursleys need never know that he was studying



magic by night



harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his



aunt and uncle at the moment as they were already



in an especially bad mood with him all because hed



received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one



week into the school vacation



ron weasley who was one of harrys best friends at



hogwarts came from a whole family of wizards this



meant that he knew a lot of things harry didnt but



had never used a telephone before most unluckily it



had been uncle vernon who had answered the call



vernon dursley speaking



harry who happened to be in the room at the time



froze as he heard rons voice answer



p a g e  



harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



hello hello can you hear me i  want 



to  talk  to  harry  potter



ron was yelling so loudly that uncle vernon jumped



and held the receiver a foot away from his ear staring



at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm



who is this he roared in the direction of the



mouthpiece who are you



ron  weasley ron bellowed back as though he



and uncle vernon were speaking from opposite ends



of a football field im  a  friend  of 



harrys  from  school 



uncle vernons small eyes swiveled around to harry



who was rooted to the spot



there is no harry potter here he roared



now holding the receiver at arms length as though



frightened it might explode i dont know what



school youre talking about never



contact me again dont you come near my



family



and he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as



if dropping a poisonous spider



the fight that had followed had been one of the worst



ever



how dare you give this number to people



like  people like you uncle vernon had



roared spraying harry with spit



ron obviously realized that hed gotten harry into



trouble because he hadnt called again harrys other



best friend from hogwarts hermione granger hadnt



been in touch either harry suspected that ron had



p a g e  



harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



warned hermione not to call which was a pity



because hermione the cleverest witch in harrys



year had muggle parents knew perfectly well how to



use a telephone and would probably have had



enough sense not to say that she went to hogwarts



so harry had had no word from any of his wizarding



friends for five long weeks and this summer was



turning out to be almost as bad as the last one there



was just one very small improvement  after



swearing that he wouldnt use her to send letters to



any of his friends harry had been allowed to let his



owl hedwig out at night uncle vernon had given in



because of the racket hedwig made if she was locked



in her cage all the time



harry finished writing about wendelin the weird and



paused to listen again the silence in the dark house



was broken only by the distant grunting snores of his



enormous cousin dudley it must be very late harry



thought his eyes were itching with tiredness



perhaps hed finish this essay tomorrow night 



he replaced the top of the ink bottle pulled an old



pillowcase from under his bed put the flashlight a



history of magic his essay quill and ink inside it got out of bed and hid



the lot under a loose floorboard



under his bed then he stood up stretched and



checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his



bedside table



it was one oclock in the morning harrys stomach



gave a funny jolt he had been thirteen years old



without realizing it for a whole hour



yet another unusual thing about harry was how little



he looked forward to his birthdays he had never



received a birthday card in his life the dursleys had



p a g e  



harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



completely ignored his last two birthdays and he had no reason to suppose



they would remember this one



harry walked across the dark room past hedwigs



large empty cage to the open window he leaned on



the sill the cool night air pleasant on his face after a



long time under the blankets hedwig had been



absent for two nights now harry wasnt worried



about her shed been gone this long before but he



hoped shed be back soon  she was the only living



creature in this house who didnt flinch at the sight of



him



harry though still rather small and skinny for his



age had grown a few inches over the last year his



jetblack hair however was just as it always had



been  stubbornly untidy whatever he did to it the



eyes behind his glasses were bright green and on his



forehead clearly visible through his hair was a thin



scar shaped like a bolt of lightning



of all the unusual things about harry this scar was



the most extraordinary of all it was not as the



dursleys had pretended for ten years a souvenir of



the car crash that had killed harrys parents because



lily and james potter had not died in a car crash



they had been murdered murdered by the most



feared dark wizard for a hundred years lord



voldemort harry had escaped from the same attack



with nothing more than a scar on his forehead where



voldemorts curse instead of killing him had



rebounded upon its originator barely alive



voldemort had fled 



but harry had come facetoface with him at



hogwarts remembering their last meeting as he



stood at the dark window harry had to admit he was



lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday



p a g e  



harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



he scanned the starry sky for a sign of hedwig



perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse



dangling from her beak expecting praise gazing



absently over the rooftops it was a few seconds before



harry realized what he was seeing



silhouetted against the golden moon and growing



larger every moment was a large strangely lopsided



creature and it was flapping in harrys direction he



stood quite still watching it sink lower and lower for



a split second he hesitated his hand on the window



latch wondering whether to slam it shut but then



the bizarre creature soared over one of the street



lamps of privet drive and harry realizing what it



was leapt aside



through the window soared three owls two of them



holding up the third which appeared to be



unconscious they landed with a soft flump on



harrys bed and the middle owl which was large and



gray keeled right over and lay motionless there was



a large package tied to its legs



harry recognized the unconscious owl at once  his



name was errol and he belonged to the weasley



family harry dashed to the bed untied the cords



around errols legs took off the parcel and then



carried errol to hedwigs cage errol opened one



bleary eye gave a feeble hoot of thanks and began to



gulp some water



harry turned back to the remaining owls one of



them the large snowy female was his own hedwig



she too was carrying a parcel and looked extremely



pleased with herself she gave harry an affectionate



nip with her beak as he removed her burden then



flew across the room to join errol



p a g e  



harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



harry didnt recognize the third owl a handsome



tawny one but he knew at once where it had come



from because in addition to a third package it was



carrying a letter bearing the hogwarts crest when



harry relieved this owl of its burden it ruffled its



feathers importantly stretched its wings and took off



through the window into the night



harry sat down on his bed and grabbed errols



package ripped off the brown paper and discovered a



present wrapped in gold and his first ever birthday



card fingers trembling slightly he opened the



envelope two pieces of paper fell out  a letter and a



newspaper clipping



the clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding



newspaper the daily prophet because the people in



the blackandwhite picture were moving harry



picked up the clipping smoothed it out and read



ministry of magic employee



scoops grand prize



arthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts



office at the ministry of magic has won the annual



daily prophet grand prize galleon draw



a delighted mr weasley told the daily prophet  we will be spending the



gold on a summer holiday in



egypt where our eldest son bill works as a curse



breaker for gringotts wizarding bank



the weasley family will be spending a month in



egypt returning for the start of the new school year



at hogwarts which five of the weasley children



currently attend



p a g e  



harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



harry scanned the moving photograph and a grin



spread across his face as he saw all nine of the



weasleys waving furiously at him standing in front of



a large pyramid plump little mrs weasley tall



balding mr weasley six sons and one daughter all



though the blackandwhite picture didnt show it



with flamingred hair right in the middle of the



picture was ron tall and gangling with his pet rat



scabbers on his shoulder and his arm around his



little sister ginny



harry couldnt think of anyone who deserved to win a



large pile of gold more than the weasleys who were



very nice and extremely poor he picked up rons



letter and unfolded it



dear harry



happy birthday



look im really sorry about that telephone call i hope



the muggles didnt give you a hard time i asked dad



and he reckons i shouldnt have shouted



its amazing here in egypt bills taken us around all



the tombs and you wouldnt believe the curses those



old egyptian wizards put on them mum wouldnt let



ginny come in the last one there were all these



mutant skeletons in there of muggles whod broken in



and grown extra heads and stuff



i couldnt believe it when dad won the daily prophet



draw seven hundred galleons most of its gone on



this trip but theyre going to buy me a new wand for



next year



harry remembered only too well the occasion when



rons old wand had snapped it had happened when



p a g e   harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



the car the two of them had been flying to hogwarts had crashed into a tree



on the school grounds



well be back about a week before term starts and



well be going up to london to get my wand and our



new books any chance of meeting you there



dont let the muggles get you down



try and come to london



ron



ps percys head boy he got the letter last week



harry glanced back at the photograph percy who



was in his seventh and final year at hogwarts was



looking particularly smug he had pinned his head



boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his



neat hair his hornrimmed glasses flashing in the



egyptian sun



harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it



inside was what looked like a miniature glass



spinning top there was another note from ron



beneath it



harry  this is a pocket sneakoscope if theres



someone untrustworthy around its supposed to light



up and spin bill says its rubbish sold for wizard



tourists and isnt reliable because it kept lighting up at



dinner last night but he didnt realize fred and george



had put beetles in his soup



bye 



ron



p a g e   harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



harry put the pocket sneakoscope on his bedside



table where it stood quite still balanced on its point



reflecting the luminous hands of his clock he looked



at it happily for a few seconds then picked up the



parcel hedwig had brought



inside this too there was a wrapped present a card



and a letter this time from hermione



dear harry



ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to



your uncle vernon i do hope youre all right



im on holiday in france at the moment and i didnt



know how i was going to send this to you  what if



theyd opened it at customs  but then hedwig



turned up i think she wanted to make sure you got



something for your birthday for a change i bought your



present by owlorder there was an advertisement in



the daily prophet ive been getting it delivered its so



good to keep up with whats going on in the wizarding
