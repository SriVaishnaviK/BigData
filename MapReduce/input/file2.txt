p a g e   harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



out of the way before you become befuddled by our



excellent feast 



dumbledore cleared his throat and continued as



you will all be aware after their search of the



hogwarts express our school is presently playing



host to some of the dementors of azkaban who are



here on ministry of magic business



he paused and harry remembered what mr weasley



had said about dumbledore not being happy with the



dementors guarding the school



they are stationed at every entrance to the grounds



dumbledore continued and while they are with us i



must make it plain that nobody is to leave school



without permission dementors are not to be fooled



by tricks or disguises  or even invisibility cloaks



he added blandly and harry and ron glanced at each



other it is not in the nature of a dementor to



understand pleading or excuses i therefore warn



each and every one of you to give them no reason to



harm you i look to the prefects and our new head



boy and girl to make sure that no student runs afoul



of the dementors he said



percy who was sitting a few seats down from harry



puffed out his chest again and stared around



impressively dumbledore paused again he looked



very seriously around the hall and nobody moved or



made a sound



on a happier note he continued i am pleased to



welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year



first professor lupin who has kindly consented to



fill the post of defense against the dark arts teacher



p a g e   harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



there was some scattered rather unenthusiastic



applause only those who had been in the



compartment on the train with professor lupin



clapped hard harry among them professor lupin



looked particularly shabby next to all the other



teachers in their best robes



look at snape ron hissed in harrys ear



professor snape the potions master was staring



along the staff table at professor lupin it was



common knowledge that snape wanted the defense



against the dark arts job but even harry who hated



snape was startled at the expression twisting his



thin sallow face it was beyond anger it was loathing



harry knew that expression only too well it was the



look snape wore every time he set eyes on harry



as to our second new appointment dumbledore



continued as the lukewarm applause for professor



lupin died away well i am sorry to tell you that



professor kettleburn our care of magical creatures



teacher retired at the end of last year in order to



enjoy more time with his remaining limbs however i



am delighted to say that his place will be filled by



none other than rubeus hagrid who has agreed to



take on this teaching job in addition to his



gamekeeping duties



harry ron and hermione stared at one another



stunned then they joined in with the applause



which was tumultuous at the gryffindor table in



particular harry leaned forward to see hagrid who



was rubyred in the face and staring down at his



enormous hands his wide grin hidden in the tangle of



his black beard



p a g e   harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



we shouldve known ron roared pounding the



table who else would have assigned us a biting



book



harry ron and hermione were the last to stop



clapping and as professor dumbledore started



speaking again they saw that hagrid was wiping his



eyes on the tablecloth



well i think thats everything of importance said



dumbledore let the feast begin



the golden plates and goblets before them filled



suddenly with food and drink harry suddenly



ravenous helped himself to everything he could reach



and began to eat



it was a delicious feast the hall echoed with talk



laughter and the clatter of knives and forks harry



ron and hermione however were eager for it to



finish so that they could talk to hagrid they knew



how much being made a teacher would mean to him



hagrid wasnt a fully qualified wizard he had been



expelled from hogwarts in his third year for a crime



he had not committed it had been harry ron and



hermione who had cleared hagrids name last year



at long last when the last morsels of pumpkin tart



had melted from the golden platters dumbledore



gave the word that it was time for them all to go to



bed and they got their chance



congratulations hagrid hermione squealed as they



reached the teachers table



all down ter you three said hagrid wiping his



shining face on his napkin as he looked up at them



can believe it  great man dumbledore  came



straight down to me hut after professor kettleburn



p a g e   harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



said hed had enough  its what i always wanted







overcome with emotion he buried his face in his



napkin and professor mcgonagall shooed them away



harry ron and hermione joined the gryffindors



streaming up the marble staircase and very tired



now along more corridors up more and more stairs



to the hidden entrance to gryffindor tower a large



portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them



password



coming through coming through percy called from



behind the crowd the new passwords fortuna



major



oh no said neville longbottom sadly he always



had trouble remembering the passwords



through the portrait hole and across the common



room the girls and boys divided toward their separate



staircases harry climbed the spiral stair with no



thought in his head except how glad he was to be



back they reached their familiar circular dormitory



with its five fourposter beds and harry looking



around felt he was home at last



p a g e   harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



talons and tea leaves



when harry ron and hermione entered the great



hall for breakfast the next day the first thing they



saw was draco malfoy who seemed to be entertaining



a large group of slytherins with a very funny story as



they passed malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a



swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter



ignore him said hermione who was right behind



harry just ignore him its not worth it 



hey potter shrieked pansy parkinson a slytherin



girl with a face like a pug potter the dementors are



coming potter woooooooo



harry dropped into a seat at the gryffindor table next



to george weasley



new thirdyear course schedules said george



passing them over whats up with you harry



malfoy said ron sitting down on georges other



side and glaring over at the slytherin table



p a g e   harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



george looked up in time to see malfoy pretending to faint with terror



again



that little git he said calmly he wasnt so cocky



last night when the dementors were down at our end



of the train came running into our compartment



didnt he fred



nearly wet himself said fred with a contemptuous



glance at malfoy



i wasnt too happy myself said george theyre



horrible things those dementors 



sort of freeze your insides dont they said fred



you didnt pass out though did you said harry in



a low voice



forget it harry said george bracingly dad had to



go out to azkaban one time remember fred and he



said it was the worst place hed ever been he came



back all weak and shaking  they suck the



happiness out of a place dementors most of the



prisoners go mad in there



anyway well see how happy malfoy looks after our



first quidditch match said fred gryffindor versus



slytherin first game of the season remember



the only time harry and malfoy had faced each other



in a quidditch match malfoy had definitely come off



worse feeling slightly more cheerful harry helped



himself to sausages and fried tomatoes



hermione was examining her new schedule



ooh good were starting some new subjects today



she said happily



p a g e   harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



hermione said ron frowning as he looked over her shoulder theyve



messed up your schedule look 



theyve got you down for about ten subjects a day



there isnt enough time 



ill manage ive fixed it all with professor



mcgonagall



but look said ron laughing see this morning



nine oclock divination and underneath nine



oclock muggle studies and  ron leaned closer to



the schedule disbelieving  look  underneath



that arithmancy nine oclock i mean i know youre



good hermione but no ones that good howre you



supposed to be in three classes at once



dont be silly said hermione shortly of course i



wont be in three classes at once



well then 



pass the marmalade said hermione



but 



oh ron whats it to you if my schedules a bit full



hermione snapped i told you ive fixed it all with



professor mcgonagall



just then hagrid entered the great hall he was



wearing his long moleskin overcoat and was



absentmindedly swinging a dead polecat from one



enormous hand



all righ he said eagerly pausing on the way to the



staff table yer in my firs ever lesson right after



lunch bin up since five gettin everythin ready 



hope its okay  me a teacher  honesly 



p a g e   harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



he grinned broadly at them and headed off to the



staff table still swinging the polecat



wonder what hes been getting ready said ron a



note of anxiety in his voice



the hall was starting to empty as people headed off



toward their first lesson ron checked his course



schedule



wed better go look divinations at the top of north



tower itll take us ten minutes to get there 



they finished their breakfasts hastily said goodbye



to fred and george and walked back through the



hall as they passed the slytherin table malfoy did



yet another impression of a fainting fit the shouts of



laughter followed harry into the entrance hall



the journey through the castle to north tower was a



long one two years at hogwarts hadnt taught them



everything about the castle and they had never been



inside north tower before



theres  got  to  be  a  shortcut ron



panted as they climbed their seventh long staircase



and emerged on an unfamiliar landing where there



was nothing but a large painting of a bare stretch of



grass hanging on the stone wall



i think its this way said hermione peering down



the empty passage to the right



cant be said ron thats south look you can see



a bit of the lake out of the window 



harry was watching the painting a fat dapplegray



pony had just ambled onto the grass and was grazing



nonchalantly harry was used to the subjects of



p a g e   harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their frames to visit one



another but he always enjoyed



watching it a moment later a short squat knight in



a suit of armor clanked into the picture after his



pony by the look of the grass stains on his metal



knees he had just fallen off



aha he yelled seeing harry ron and hermione



what villains are these that trespass upon my



private lands come to scorn at my fall perchance



draw you knaves you dogs



they watched in astonishment as the little knight



tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began



brandishing it violently hopping up and down in



rage but the sword was too long for him a



particularly wild swing made him overbalance and he



landed facedown in the grass



are you all right said harry moving closer to the



picture



get back you scurvy braggart back you rogue



the knight seized his sword again and used it to push



himself back up but the blade sank deeply into the



grass and though he pulled with all his might he



couldnt get it out again finally he had to flop back



down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his



sweating face



listen said harry taking advantage of the knights



exhaustion were looking for the north tower you



dont know the way do you



a quest the knights rage seemed to vanish



instantly he clanked to his feet and shouted come



follow me dear friends and we shall find our goal or



else shall perish bravely in the charge



p a g e   harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  jk rowling



he gave the sword another fruitless tug tried and failed to mount the fat



pony gave up and cried on



foot then good sirs and gentle lady on on



and he ran clanking loudly into the left side of the



frame and out of sight



they hurried after him along the corridor following



the sound of his armor every now and then they



spotted him running through a picture ahead



be of stout heart the worst is yet to come yelled the



knight and they saw him reappear in front of an



alarmed group of women in crinolines whose picture



hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase



puffing loudly harry ron and hermione climbed the



tightly spiraling steps getting dizzier and dizzier



until at last they heard the murmur of voices above



them and knew they had reached the classroom



farewell cried the knight popping his head into a



painting of some sinisterlooking monks farewell



my comradesinarms if ever you have need of noble



heart and steely sinew call upon sir cadogan



yeah well call you muttered ron as the knight



disappeared if we ever need someone mental



they climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a



tiny landing where most of the class was already



assembled there were no doors off this landing but



ron nudged harry and pointed at the ceiling where



there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on



it



 sibyll trelawney divination teacher  harry read



howre we supposed to get up there
